# Multi-Classification of Knee Osteoarthritis Severity Using Convolution Neural Networks

This notebook contains CNN models used to classify X-ray images of osteoarthritis of the knee. The images are ranked on the Kellgren-Lawrence severity scale ranging from 0-4 corresponding to normal, doubtful, mild, moderate, and severe. Multiple CNN models were constructed to evaluate which model framework would perform the best. A CNN made from the ground up, pre-trained models VGG19 and ResNeet50, and a combination model of the handmade CNN and VGG19 were compared against one another.
